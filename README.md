# USACO-Problems
These are solutions to the *USA Computing Olympiad* (USACO) training center's practice problems (train.usaco.org). I will continue to update this repository with solutions as I progress through the modules. I am looking to improve from my previous programming contest expertise, which, while granting me success through regional and provincial progamming competitions, has left me a bit unaware of some of the more algoritmically complex solutions. I coded solutions for the earlier sections of this training center a long time ago, so although they aren't in this repository, I'm sure they're either on one of my personal hard drives, or various school laboratory PCs, forever lost to the wind. Not anything to complex/impressive there, but I'll try  to find the solutions soon. Some of these solutions may in no way be the least complex, but I tend to progress to the next problem if my solution passes the grader's strict time requirements (for my sanity).
